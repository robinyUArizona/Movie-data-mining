# Spark-Shortest-Paths-in-a-Graph
Write a Spark solution to finding the length of the shortest paths from a specified source node (given as a command line argument) in a graph to all other nodes and also return the length of the longest shortest path from that vertex. . Then extend the solution to compute the diameter of the graph, aka “degrees of separation.” The diameter is the length of the longest shortest path over al  vertices in the graph.
