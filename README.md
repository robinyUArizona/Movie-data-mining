# Project 4: Data Science with Spark for Movie Data Mining

* Author: Simon & Robin
* Class: CS535 Section 1
* Semester: Fall 2021

## Overview

The project goal is to use spark to extract trends from movies ratings database.


## Reflection
The project was pretty straight forward. Our experience with HW4 gave us a good background on sparks available
functions and helped us in this project. One of the challenges we faced was with missing values
in the data. We also needed to write our code differently for the larger data set due to a difference in format.
We had various learning moments. We explored the difference between pnadas dataframe and spark dataframe. We answered following questions using 1m (small dataset): <br>
Q1. k highest average rated movies of all time <br>
Q2. k highest averaged rated movies for a particular year <br>
Q3. k highest averaged rated movies for a certain age group <br>
Q4. Age group that is most likely to post a review for a movie, for Males/Females
Q5. k highest averaged rated movies for a particular month - season


## Compiling and Using
To develop our program we use vs code with python and pyspark extension. You will need python3                       and pyspark installed. To run the program, keep the input (unzipped) in the same directory as the program.
Run using python3 [pprogram_name] command.
